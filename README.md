# Deep-Neural-Network-Implementation

This is implementation of several deep learning models in Python without using any machine learning platform languages or packages. Models implemented are as follows. 

1. Neural Network
2. Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)
3. Restribted Boltzman Machine(RBM)
4. Deep Restricted Boltzman Machine(DRBM)
5. Autoencoder
6. Denoising Autoencoder

To run, simply call ``train.py``.
